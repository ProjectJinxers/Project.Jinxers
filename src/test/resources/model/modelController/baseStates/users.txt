This is not a resource file! There are no plain-text credentials stored in the system. This file's purpose is to keep
track of the users, that are stored in the base states json files. Without this additional information, there is no
way to actually make use of those users in derived test scenarios (except for user and newOwner, as there are constants
in the test classes).

user:pass
second:pass2
third:pass3
fourth:pass4
user<i>:pass<i> (i in [5, 24])

newOwner:newpass
